# Design notes

What are the most important metrics?

- Size of the binary => install time
- Ease of contribution: tsx or ts-node
- "Cool" factor: deno or dart?
- Performance: golang

I do fear that something will end up running as a ci/cd check,
and optimizing for install time, in this situation, would be good.
